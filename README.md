# David's virtual machine
Hobby project of creating something akin to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) including an assembler and maybe even a compiler for a custom programming language at some point.

## Building
The build system is CMake
For windows it comes with build.bat, which by default uses MinGW:
```shell
$ ./build.bat
...
[ 45%] Built target VM
...
$ [100%] Built target assembler
```
Linux folks can probably figure it out on their own
